On Mac, it should simply be `/Applications/Julia-1.5.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia` (we recommend setting an alias).

To add packages, open the REPL and type `]`, which opens up the package manager. Then, write `add <name>`, where `<name` is replaced with the name of the package of interest. Most
